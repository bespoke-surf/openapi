# Bespoke's OpenAPI Specification

This repo contains versioned copies of our [OpenAPI spec](https://www.openapis.org/).

This is the same spec we use to generate our [API Docs](https://bespoke-api.readme.io/reference/createsubscriber).

Make test calls with the new API collection in our [Postman Workspace](https://www.postman.com/bespoke-surf/workspace/bespoke-developers)
